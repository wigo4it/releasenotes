### Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for Releasenotes App

#### 1. Overview

**Purpose:**
The Releasenotes App aims to provide a web-based platform to display and manage release notes derived from backlog items in Azure DevOps. The app ensures that updates from Azure DevOps are synchronized hourly and organizes the data for clear, structured presentation to users. The system is designed for public, view-only access with the ability to export releasenotes to PDF.

**Scope:**
The app supports two applications, "Socrates" and "ServicesEnInteratie," and groups backlog items by releases defined in Azure DevOps. Key features include hourly synchronization, PDF export, and error tracking for synchronization processes.

**Objectives:**
- Ensure up-to-date synchronization with Azure DevOps.
- Provide a public interface for viewing and filtering releasenotes.
- Enable PDF export of releasenotes for offline use.
- Offer error notification for synchronization issues.

#### 2. Functional Requirements

1. **Synchronization with Azure DevOps:**
   - Synchronize backlog items with Azure DevOps every hour.
   - Maintain a database of synchronized items, including the last modified timestamp.

2. **Release Information Management:**
   - Retrieve release information directly from Azure DevOps.
   - Ensure that backlog items are linked to a single release.

3. **Releasenotes Display:**
   - Display releasenotes grouped by application and release.
   - Provide filters to switch between applications (Socrates or ServicesEnInteratie).

4. **PDF Export:**
   - Generate a PDF file for releasenotes for a selected release.
   - Include application name, release version, and a list of associated items in the PDF.

5. **Error Tracking:**
   - Log errors encountered during synchronization processes.
   - Notify administrators of any synchronization failures.

#### 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:**
  - Synchronization process must complete within 5 minutes.
  - Web interface should load releasenotes within 2 seconds for up to 1000 items.

- **Scalability:**
  - Support up to 10,000 backlog items without performance degradation.

- **Usability:**
  - Provide a user-friendly and intuitive interface for filtering and viewing releasenotes.

- **Reliability:**
  - Ensure 99.9% uptime for synchronization and web services.

- **Security:**
  - Secure data transmission during synchronization using HTTPS.

#### 4. User Interface Design

- **Web Interface:**
  - Homepage displays releasenotes grouped by application and release.
  - Filter options for selecting "Socrates" or "ServicesEnInteratie."
  - Export button for PDF generation located on each release page.

---

#### 5. Data Management

- **Database Structure:**
  - Backlog Items Table: Stores item ID, title, description, release ID, last modified timestamp.
  - Releases Table: Stores release ID, name, version, and associated application.

- **Data Synchronization:**
  - Hourly updates fetch backlog items and release details from Azure DevOps.

---

#### 6. Security Requirements

- **Data Security:**
  - Use HTTPS for all data exchanges between the app and Azure DevOps.
  - Encrypt database entries for sensitive fields.

- **Access Control:**
  - The app is publicly accessible with no user authentication required.

---

#### 7. Constraints

- **Technology Stack:**
  - Backend: Node.js with Express.
  - Frontend: EJS templates with Bootstrap.
  - Database: Azure Cosmos DB with SQL API.

- **Legal:**
  - Ensure compliance with GDPR for data handling if user data is ever included in future versions.

- **Budget:**
  - The solution must remain cost-effective, with cloud hosting capped at a monthly budget of $500.

#### 8. Glossary

- **Azure DevOps:** A Microsoft tool used for source control, backlog management, and continuous integration.
- **Releasenotes:** A structured document summarizing the changes in a software release.
- **Backlog Items:** Tasks, bugs, or features tracked within Azure DevOps.
- **Synchronization:** The process of fetching and updating data from Azure DevOps into the app's database.
